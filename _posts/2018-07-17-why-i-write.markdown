George Orwell said in his essay [**"Why I Write."**](http://srjcstaff.santarosa.edu/~mheydon/whywriteD.pdf) that before anyone begins spewing content relevant to their age they must acquire an emotional attitude. Many in my world would call it a bias, but without it there is probably feeble impulse to write. 

I feel that at this point of my life I have accumulated a healthy amount of bias and I am ready to stand behind those choices.  I have always been averse to sharing my preferences with the world before and have thus eschewed social media in trying to remain as private as possible. 

However, I am at a stage where I have started feeling the impulse to share. I wondered why that was and Orwell thinks that a cocktail of the following ingredients is responsible for the drive to generate content--

**(i) Sheer egoism** : He thinks it is to 'seem clever' , be famous, be immortalized in the pages of the abyss that is the internet, or get back at the bullies of your childhood ( that's a euphemism for parents ... reverse that).  Basically, vanity.  I agree with him on the point that not many people have it in them to remain selfish enough to write as they grow older. Only the upper crust. 

**(ii)Aesthetic Enthusiasm** : For the love of creating beautiful things. This is the reason for writing in Python over Java too.  For instance, it can be a font choice or the color palette of website. But in the Orwellian world there exists some appreciation of beauty that inspires creation. 

**(iii)Political Purpose** : He encourages the reader to consider the term 'politics' in it's broadest sense. He urges us to think of it as  the drive of wanting to nudging the world into a certain direction.  

**(iv)Historical Impulse** : This reason has to do with reporting the point of view of the writer so he/she can report on what happened as a record for posterity.  So basically like maintaining a diary. 

Am I vain? Most definitely. 
Am I an aesthete? Probably. 
Am I political?  iOS > Android. So, yes. 
But my main reason to write is the last one: Note taking.  

**Tldr : I'm finally biased enough to write.**
